# Java-JSON-Serializer
This project is a Java to JSON (and vise versa) converted heavily inspired by Jackson. I made this project in order to learn about and familiarize myself with reflection in Java.

json-serializer-*.jar: Contains my JSON serializer. Relies on the other json jar in this project, which is a JSON parser. 

This project is inspired by Jackson found at https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson.
