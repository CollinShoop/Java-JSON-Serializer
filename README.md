# Java-JSON-Serializer
This project is a JSON to Java object and Java to JSON converter heavily inspired by Jackson (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson). 

I made this project in order to learn about and familiarize myself with reflection in Java.

json-serializer-*.jar: Contains my JSON serializer. Relies on the other json jar in this project, which is a JSON parser.
