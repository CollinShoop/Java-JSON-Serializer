# Javason

It's Java, and JSON. 

Tool to convert JSON to Java object and Java object to JSON. This is definitely a ripoff version of [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).

## Why?

Building powerful and flexible code is interesting to me. Something abstract like serialization, via Java Reflection, sounded like a great execrcise in recursion, type handling, and raw inputs processing, and general usage of reflection.
